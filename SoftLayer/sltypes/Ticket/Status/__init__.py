class Ticket_Status(Entity):
    """The SoftLayer_Ticket_Status data type models the state of a ticket as it is worked by SoftLayer and its
customers. Tickets exist in one of three states:  *'''OPEN''': Open tickets are considered unresolved issues
by SoftLayer and can be assigned to a SoftLayer employee for work. Tickets created by portal or API users are
created in the Open state. *'''ASSIGNED''': Assigned tickets are identical to open tickets, but are assigned
to an individual SoftLayer employee. An assigned ticket is actively being worked by SoftLayer. *'''CLOSED''':
Tickets are closed when the issue at hand is considered resolved. A SoftLayer employee can change a ticket's
status from Closed to Open or Assigned if the need arises.   A ticket usually goes from the Open to Assigned
to Closed states during its life cycle. If a ticket is forwarded from one department to another it may change
from the Assigned state back to Open until it is assigned to a member of the new department."""
